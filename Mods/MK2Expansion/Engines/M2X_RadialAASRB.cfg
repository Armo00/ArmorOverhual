    @description = Noting that jet engines work by compressing a bunch of air, heating it, and expelling it out a hole, our eengineers wondered if something similar could be done to improve the efficiency of rockets in atmospheric flight. The AASRB was the result. Featuring an integrated ram air-intake and modified combustion chamber, this SRB, while more expensive and heavier than a standard SRB, benefits from dynamic thrust and ISP while in an atmosphere. The higher the mach number, the better the thrust and ISP of this engine, topping off at about 400kN and 625 ISP at mach 3.
