    @description = In an attempt to improve atmospheric efficiency of rocket engines, our engineers took lessons from jet engine design principles. By mounting a rocket within a combustion manifold, then ducting intake air through it, the result is functionally similar to a ramjet engine, greatly improving engine efficiency while in an atmosphere. While heavier and less powerful than a standard rocket engine of the same size, it boasts much higher fuel efficiency while in an atmosphere. Like the AASRBS, as speed increases, so too does thrust and ISP, topping off at about 850kN and 670 ISP at mach 3.
