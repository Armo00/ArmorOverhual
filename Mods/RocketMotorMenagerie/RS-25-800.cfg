	%description = The SSME-TMI is a engine derived from the SSME with a gigantic nozzle with a 1:800 expansion ratio that provides very high performance in vacuum. It was proposed for use as a Trans-Mars Injection engine and for use on upper stages to propel Mars-bound super heavy payloads. Much like the SSME-150, due to the thermal conditions on-orbit, the nozzle and LOX turbine and ducting need to painted with white thermal paint.
