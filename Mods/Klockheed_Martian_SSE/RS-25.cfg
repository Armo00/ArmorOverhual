	%description = The RS-25, also known as the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME), is a LH2/LOX fuel-rich staged combustion engine. Though complex and expensive, these engines provide very high performance and are extremely reliable. Three of these engines powered each Shuttle Orbiter and four will be used on the core stage of the SLS.
