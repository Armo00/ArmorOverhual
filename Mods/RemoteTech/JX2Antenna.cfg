    @title = JU1 Medium Deployable High-Speed Antenna
    @description = This rather good sized, high-powered antenna was originally a garden variety umbrella. Commissioned by Blinkenlights LLC, this part is great for easy-to-launch, long range relay satellites. It is optimized towards high data transfer rate, at the cost of higher stability and power requirement. Rated for 30 billion km (200AU).

    @title = JX2 Large Deployable Faster-than-Light Communication System
    @description = This enormous, high-powered relay antenna was commissioned by Blinkenlights LLC after someone asked "What happens if we go further out than the Solar system?"  It most definitely is not in response to any vessels having accidentally already achieved an escape trajectory from the system.  Nope, nothing to do with that issue at all. Rated for 100 light year.

    @description = This rather large, high-powered antenna was created as an off-shoot of the tech domenstrator from the JX2. Commissioned by Blinkenlights LLC, this part is primarily targeted for those probes and rovers destined to head a bit further out than the last lot. It is capable unique for large volume communication at the cost of higher power consumption and less range. Rated for 20 billion km (133AU).
