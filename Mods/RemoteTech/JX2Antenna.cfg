    @description = This enormous, high-powered relay antenna was commissioned by Blinkenlights LLC after someone asked "What happens if we go further out than the Solar system?"  It most definitely is not in response to any vessels having accidentally already achieved an escape trajectory from the system.  Nope, nothing to do with that issue at all. Rated for 100 light year.

    @description = This rather large, high-powered antenna was created as an off-shoot of the tech domenstrator from the JX2. Commissioned by Blinkenlights LLC, this part is primarily targeted for those probes and rovers destined to head a bit further out than the last lot. It is capable unique for capable of covering a wide range of the sky at the cost of higher power consumption and less range. Rated for 2 billion km.
