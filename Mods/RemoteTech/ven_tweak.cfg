    @description = The Communotron 88-88-V directional antenna allows for far more reliable communication at higher speed than previous models. This is thanks in part to its patented parabolic folding design. ISPE's research team maintains it was not inspired by an umbrella, but clearly this one is based on an umbrella.  Looks like the manufacturer forgot to put the protective fairing on it. Still, it is a little lighter and they're willing to discount the price as well. Rated for 400.0Mbps @8.824AU.
